Amber's expression suddenly changes to a much more surprised and worried expression.
"Wait, what?" he responds, in a much more deep and serious tone than before.
"yeah im hungry as FUCK dude", you respond
"Do you at least have any food stored up from last cycle?"
"nah, im on empty rn"
"...and you're telling me this as the shelter's closing?"

Gawk at the doors as they begin to close.
