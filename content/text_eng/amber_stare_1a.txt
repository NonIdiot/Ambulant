You ignore the orange slugcat, deciding to instead find something else to stare at.
You begin to see something else that catches your eye, when-
"HEY! Are you even listening to me?!? This is an important thing I'm trying to tell you here!"
the hefty slugcat says, in an attempt to get your attention back.

"wh- whuh??"
