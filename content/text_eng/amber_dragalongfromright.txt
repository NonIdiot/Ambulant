Before you can finish, Amber cuts you off, saying, "Wait- never mind, I just remembered
the right path's pretty dangerous. You know, leeches, centipedes, the whole deal.
Anyways, let's head left!"
Begrudgingly, you head with Amber through the left pipe. After a bit more nice scenery and an odd
lack of hostile creatures, you finally make it to a clearing, of which has an entrance to a shelter.
"Alright, let's head in!" Amber says, seeming quite excited to be with you.

Enter the shelter.
