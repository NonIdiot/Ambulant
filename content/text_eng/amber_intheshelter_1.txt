As you enter, you see a very well-decorated Ancient Shelter, filled with hanging lanterns,
graffiti on the wall, and even a cozy-looking section of the floor, seemingly made from
soft and squishy materials. It's, in fact, probably the coziest shelter you've found.
You and him sit on the softer section of the floor together, staring into each other's eyes.
Could this be your long-awaited mate? Could Amber be the one?
Just as you ponder this, your stomach begins to rumble.

Say "man, i havent eaten ANYTHING today" to Amber.
