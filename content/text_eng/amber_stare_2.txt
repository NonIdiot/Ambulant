The hefty slugcat looks at you with a very annoyed expression.
"Look, point is, I can't trust you. Even though I understand your desires, I still can't allow you in."
You look back to where the orange slugcat was, but they're gone now. You retort back with, "well i dont care lol".

Maneuver your way past.
