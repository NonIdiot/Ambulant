You stare even more at the orange slugcat, who still doesn't know that you're there.
You notice that they're carrying the box of things confidently, as though it was no trouble to them.
Something else on the slugcat catches your eye, when-
"HEY! Are you even listening to me?!? This is an important thing I'm trying to tell you here!"
the hefty slugcat says, in an attempt to get your attention back.

"wh- whuh??"
