The orange slugcat pauses for a second, then stares off into the distance for a bit,
and then it almost seems as though a lightbulb flashes over their head.
"Oh- m... oh- wait- OHHHHHHH...", he says. "I see what you're getting at now."
He then flashes you 'the look'. However, before you can reciprocate, you hear a
set of footsteps behind you, As you turn around, you see the hefty slugcat storming towards you.

Nervously back up.
