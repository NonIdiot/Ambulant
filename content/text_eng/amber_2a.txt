Upon closer inspection, you see that this orange slugcat has some blob-like dark spots on the
top and bottom of their tail. They also seem to be carrying the box as though it were lightweight,
despite it being filled with things like spears and Squidcada corpses. Perhaps they are good at
climbing poles. Regardless, you also see that their ears are partially missing. Whether they are
folded inward or partially cut is impossible to tell from behind.
